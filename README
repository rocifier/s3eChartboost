Currently this extension only supports android. Feel free to add iOS support! Improvements welcome!
Released under LGPL (see lgpl.txt).

Note: Only "named" chartboost functions are supported currently, so if you create or cache anything,
you have to give it a reference name in the function parameters. This can be basically whatever you want.
